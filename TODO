TODO:

- Scrollbar glitch in IE
- Font selection, Courier or Fixedsys, if both are available (use some font detection method).
- Quick help for commands
- Title alert when window is out of focus (improve that, it's not working
  perfectly).
- Simple and intuitive log saving in html (well, flash is boring, it does not
  let me call FileReference.save() through ExternalInterface, I'm thinking in
  some solutions but it will take more time than I expected).
- beep
- better telnet parsing

Done:

* Prewrap is not working in FF3, I think that's because of the &nbsp;'s
  generated in AnsiToHtml.hx. One idea is creating a variable in the browser
  telling if it's IE or not, then Flash can access it and know if it will
  or will not output the &nbsp;'s characters (they are necessary to make
  the output work properly in IE).
* connect/disconnect/reconnect options in connection status icon
* line counter of the output window
* clear output window (everything, half or a number of lines)
* Make copy and paste work (when selecting text do not focus the command input)
* history navigation (by pressing up/down arrow)
* swap text input with password input when echo_off
