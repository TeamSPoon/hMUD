TODO:

- Simple and intuitive log saving in html (well, flash is boring, it does not
  let me call FileReference.save() through ExternalInterface, I'm thinking in
  some solutions but it will take more time than I expected).
- beep
- clear character sequence (sent from MUD)
- better telnet parsing
- better modularization
- Multiple commands separated by ';' (or maybe a multiline textarea when doing SHIFT+ENTER)

Done:

2009-07-30:

* Now the cursor is being correctly placed at the end of the text when
  navigating through history. (Chrome, Firefox and Explorer).
* Quick help for commands (guide.js)
* save command guide state (visible or not) in user's cookie

2009-07-28:

* Title alert when window is out of focus (improved, it was not working
  perfectly).
* Font selection: Courier or Fixedsys.
* Scrollbar glitch in IE.
* Scroll lock with visual sign.
* Better modularization (incomplete).
* Layout adjusts.
* Slight improvements on color parsing and output generation.

2009-01-16:

* Prewrap is not working in FF3, I think that's because of the &nbsp;'s
  generated in AnsiToHtml.hx. One idea is creating a variable in the browser
  telling if it's IE or not, then Flash can access it and know if it will
  or will not output the &nbsp;'s characters (they are necessary to make
  the output work properly in IE).
* connect/disconnect/reconnect options in connection status icon
* line counter of the output window
* clear output window (everything, half or a number of lines)
* Make copy and paste work (when selecting text do not focus the command input)
* history navigation (by pressing up/down arrow)
* swap text input with password input when echo_off
